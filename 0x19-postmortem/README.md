# Issue Summary

03/18/2023 From 11 AM to 12:20 AM  an incident occurred where unauthorized root access was granted within the container environment due to the default setup running all processes under the root user

# Timeline

- 11:10 AM : A developer attempted to perform routine tasks within the container environment but mistakenly executed a command with unintended consequences.
- 11:15 AM : The command `rm -rf /` was mistakenly executed within the container, resulting in the deletion of critical system files and data.
- 11:15 AM : An alert was triggered by the system monitoring tool detecting unusual activity within the container environment.
- 11:20 AM : Immediate action was taken to halt all container operations and assess the extent of the damage.
- 11:24 AM : It was confirmed that the root directory and essential system files were irrecoverably deleted due to the erroneous command execution.

# Root cause and resolution

The primary root cause of this incident was the default configuration of the container environment, which ran all processes under the root user. This setup granted excessive privileges to users within the container, allowing them to execute commands with unrestricted access to system resources.

# Corrective and preventative measures

In response to the unauthorized root access incident within the container environment, immediate corrective actions were taken, including halting all container operations, initiating data recovery efforts, and conducting a thorough incident analysis. To prevent similar incidents, a user-specific command execution script was developed, promoting least privilege principles and reducing the reliance on root access. Additionally, ongoing reviews of container security configurations, implementation of role-based access control, continuous monitoring, and user training initiatives were established to fortify the security posture and foster a culture of proactive security awareness within the organization. These measures collectively aim to mitigate risks, enhance container security, and minimize the likelihood of future unauthorized access incidents.
